				<br />And break the cycle,
				<br />We take it where we wanna go, can’t tell us no,

				<br />The skies have opened.
				<br />Despite the pain,
				<br />We march in hope and
				<br />We work for change.
				<br />
				<br />We fight the odds
				<br />But all the decks have been well stacked.
				<br />But still we muddle through
				<br />The forest of attacks.
				<br />
				<br />Against the raging tides,
				<br />The saboteurs, the hate,
				<br />We will stand our ground,
				<br />Know we're safe and sound,
				<br />But when the cannons breach the gates, (it's)
				<br />
				<br />Time to cry and feel regret,
				<br />Cause <div class="titledrop">Minus Sixty</div> is all you will get.
				<br />Spent hours hard at work and drenched in sweat,
				<br />But <div class="titledrop">Minus Sixty</div> is all we get.
				<br />Face the music, read the room,
				<br />We're slowly marching to all of our dooms,
				<br />Although we had a chance to change our track,
				<br />Well, <div class="titledrop">Minus Sixty</div>'s the end of that.
				<br />
				<br />Just be honest,

				<br />The talking's over,
				<br />And we've all seen the evidence.
				<br />
				<br />Think what you want,
				<br />But have the courage to say no.
				<br />They've worked their magic,
				<br />We all know how this'll go.
				<br />
				<br />Behind the spin, the din
				<br />Of kings sipping their gin,
				<br />Oh the truth is there,
				<br />But the sleuths are scared,
				<br />And they'll blow up every sin.
				<br />
				<br />Time to cry and feel regret,

				<br />And when I'm looking at the

				<br />It's like the world has turned to stone
				<br />And on the bus I feel alone
				<br />Cause I can't trust the ones I know
				<br />Don't make a fuss, don't let it show
				<br />Contain emotions, let it go
				<br />
				<br />They tell me it won't be so bad
				<br />But who can look around and say
				<br />That there's no reason to be sad
				<br />Cause we'll all live another day
				<br />We know that things will not be getting better
				<br />Nine years on, I still remember
				<br />Worked to death for sake of profits
				<br />Tried our best but couldn't stop it

				<br />
				<br />Just take it as it goes, not like the world will know,
				<br />There’s nothing left to show except the status quo.
				<br />Turns out that they had lied, don’t know why you’re surprised,
				<br />We saw them override, they betrayed us from inside.
				<br />
				<br />And from our own, we saw the billions of chances we’d blown,
				<br />With hindsight twenty-twenty vision we’ll know.
				<br />But despite our mistakes, we were riddled with fakes,
				<br />Doing all it would take to slam on the brakes.
				<br />
				<br />The four organs are calling,
				<br />Let the curtains fall.
				<br />
				<br />Oh yeah <div class="titledrop">the show</div>, it <div class="titledrop">must go on,</div>
				<br />Don’t let this be our final song,
				<br />The music’s fading fast,
				<br />We have to be the last,
				<br />The last ones standing on the ground,
				<br />Two hands we hold on, safe and sound,
				<br />The rocks, they’re crumbling round,
				<br />We’re close to falling down.
				<br />
				<br />Now I won’t pretend that there’s nothing wrong
				<br />With our tactics, our schematics, and the dance and song.
				<br />Every stumble, there’s lessons to be learned,
				<br />As far as optics are concerned.
				<br />
				<br />But we can’t bunker down,
				<br />Where we’ve found renown’s a shield from sound,
				<br />We’ve all seen slander, that’s unfair,
				<br />But that don’t mean there’s nothing there.
				<br />
				<br />When the numbers are counted,
				<br />And there’s no going back.
				<br />
				<br />Oh yeah <div class="titledrop">the show</div>, it <div class="titledrop">must go on,</div>
				<br />Don’t let this be our final song,

				<br />Two hands we hold on, safe and sound,
				<br />The rocks, they’re crumbling round,
				<br />We’re close to falling down.
				<br />
				<br />So toughen up, bloody toughen up,
				<br />We’ll stand our ground fighting till we drop.
				<br />While traitors trade on hate and fear,
				<br />At the end of the day, we’ll still be standing here.
				<br />
				<br />So maybe we lost one,
				<br />But we’ll win the next.
				<br />
				<br />Oh we won’t stop, the fight goes on,
				<br />Cause this won’t be our final song,
				<br />The music’s fading fast,
				<br />But we will be the last,
				<br />The last ones standing on the ground,
				<br />We’re strong and stable, safe and sound,
				<br />The rocks may crumble round,
				<br />But we will never be brought down.
