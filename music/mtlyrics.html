				<br />Modern times left me disappointed,
				<br />The neon lights we were promised haven’t arrived.
				<br />The future’s bleak, and worse, it is bland and annoying
				<br />Our mundane dystopia, how will we survive?
				<br />With the world at our backs, we’ll just
				<br />
				<br />Face the sun, take your time.
				<br />‘Cause when the demons come, oh we will be divine.
				<br />Cyberpunks on the run,
				<br />The <div class="titledrop">Modern Technic</div> of our lives, our story’s only just begun.

				<br />As <div class="titledrop">Jupiter</div> rises above the horizon,
				<br />Your eyes are surprised, advertised to by drones in the sky,
				<br />What’cha wanna buy?
				<br />The sunset is sponsored by earbuds and games,
				<br />As the heavens themselves try to sell out their fame,
				<br />What a shame, they’re all the same.
				<br /> 
				<br />Something’s in the water, something can’t be seen,
				<br />As the demons spread their wings, go riding free,
				<br />The ninety-ninth call to action, would you like to round up your order?
				<br />We’re sure that the poor would adore your compassion,
				<br />And we pinky promise that it’s not our taxes.
				<br /> 
				<br />Blood and ashes, how did everything turn fascist?
				<br />Think we’ve left it far too long and now our future’s all but gone,
				<br />And when we’re up against the wall and there is no-one left to call,
				<br />We’re reassured that when the end times come at least we won’t be bored,
				<br /> 
				<br />And when the plastic and petrol give way to the chrome and lights,
				<br />The fire tunnel that we’re destined to all die in will writhe in RGB,
				<br />And our last moments will make some epic content
				<br />For your family to watch while they eat.
				<br /> 
				<br />(‘Cause) as <div class="titledrop">Jupiter</div> falls through the trees in the forest,
				<br />The shadows of all of our fears looked and saw what we are,
				<br />We won’t get far,
				<br />And the halos of angels are buzzing like signs made of neon,
				<br />With lungs full of freon, we reach for the stars,
				<br />From Earth to Mars.

				<br />Come alive, come alive, come alive,
				<br />There's a myriad of petty little things you gotta do to stay alive
				<br />Nine to five, nine to five, nine to five,
				<br />Every other waking hour making labour just in order to survive
				<br />Take a right, take a right, take a right,
				<br />Every day the world is turning, always churning, always getting into fights
				<br />What a sight, what a sight, what a sight,
				<br />As the rats they come a-racing down the tunnel at the end I see a light
				<br />
				<br />Oh, it’s an oncoming train,
				<br />You thought you had a chance to survive there,
				<br />In for a world of pain,
				<br />You can’t even make a complaint, or escalate,
				<br />It’s just your fate, see it’s too late, we’ll set you straight,
				<br />You’re in no state, to bring the hate up to the table,
				<br />Take every day as it goes,
				<br />Ask no questions, get no lies, don’t even try.
				<br />
				<br />Gonna die, gonna die, gonna die,
				<br />As the Earth is slowly choking they’re polluting all the oceans and the skies
				<br />Big surprise, big surprise, big surprise,
				<br />They’ll be dead before they see the full effects of what we told them was unwise
				<br />Tell a lie, tell a lie, tell a lie,
				<br />Tell us anything to keep us in our beds and stop the ultraviolet light
				<br />It’s the time, it’s the time, it’s the time,
				<br />Should have started long ago but failing that we’ll meet today and set it right
				<br />
				<br />Oh, it’s the gathering storm,
				<br />You thought you had a chance to escape there,
				<br />Oh, you can have your reform,
				<br />I say good luck, you’ll get nowhere, a vacant stare,
				<br />Are you aware, it won’t be fair, see they’ve prepared,
				<br />Billionaires, see they will tear you to shreds there,
				<br />Take all the fires to them,
				<br />Asking nicely, look how little they will care.
				<br />
				<br />The statistics will tell you you’re still alive,
				<br />But there’s only so much that can ever mean.
				<br />After all, this is the Year of our Lord twenty-
				<br />I’ve lost count. They move all the same to me.
				<br />
				<br />Slowly suffocating; they’ve closed the <div class="titledrop">Window</div>.
				<br />I’ll die from poison A, or I’ll die from poison B.
				<br />Behind the wall they built with hearts and souls of stone,
				<br />Our job will not be finished till they end up just as cold.
				<br />
				<br />The world's on fire.
				<br />
				<br />Who lit the match, set it burning?
				<br />Who added fuel, kept it turning?
				<br />The world’s on fire.
				<br />Who brought the kindling to the flame,
				<br />But then refuses to take the blame?
				<br />The world’s on fire.
				<br />
				<br />Who toasts marshmallows on the ashes of our souls?
				<br />And stands united when resistance starts to grow?
				<br />We’re told there’s good ones, and then they stick up for the bad,
				<br />Then tell the papers how our mean words made them sad!
				<br />The world’s on fire.
				<br />The world’s on fire.
				<br />
				<br />So: take the fire back to them.
				<br />They’ll be burning ‘till the end.
				<br />Tear their castles down to stone.
				<br />Want to stop the violence? Start with your own
				<br />Say non-lethal, that’s a lie,
				<br />They put a bullet between her eyes.
				<br />See the whistle, see the bells.
				<br />See we’re living in living hell.
